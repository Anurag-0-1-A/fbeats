# Azure Farmbeats: Plant Monitoring System

## About Farmbeats 
Several studies have demonstrated the need to significantly increase the worldâ€™s food production by 2050. However, there is a limited amount of additional arable land, and water levels have also been receding. Although technology could help the farmer, its adoption is limited because the farms usually do not have power or Internet connectivity, and the farmers are typically not technology savvy. I am working towards an end-to-end approach, from sensors to the cloud, to solve the problem.
